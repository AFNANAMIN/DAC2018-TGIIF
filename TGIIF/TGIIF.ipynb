    "# Object detection on PYNQ\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook demonstrates the typical working flow of our solution. In our solution, a shared library `libssd.so` is first created from C/C++ sources and NN models, with the help of [DNNDK](http://www.deephi.com/dnndk.html). `libssd.so` exports necessary handlers to initialize, operate and terminate the object detection IP (DPU) running on the fabric. Then, the python notebook accesses the shared library and its exposed handlers to interact with the fabric. Most scheduling work is done within the shared library. For details, refer to the C++ codes.\n",

The simplest mode (ABI, in-line) already satisfies our need. First, exported interfaces are declared again in Python; then the shared library is opened. With `cffi.new` we are free to pass the arguments and call the functions in the shared library now."
